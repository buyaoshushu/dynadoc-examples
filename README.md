This repo contains a few minimal examples of ClojureScript projects configured with [Dynadoc](https://github.com/oakes/Dynadoc).

* To run `basic-boot-cljs`, go into its folder and do `boot run-docs`
* To run `basic-lein-cljs`, go into its folder and do `lein cljsbuild once && lein dynadoc --port 5000`

Here is a static page generated by one of these example projects:
